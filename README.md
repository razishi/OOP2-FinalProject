General Explanation:

In "Where's My Water?", the goal is to guide water to Swampy the Alligator's bathtub by 
digging paths through dirt and manipulating various objects. Here's how you  play the game:

Digging Paths: You use your  mouse to dig paths through dirt to create channels for water 
to flow. The dirt can be dug away by swiping or clicking on it.

Collecting Ducks: Each level has three rubber ducks that you need to collect along with
 getting water to Swampy. These ducks are often in tricky places that require clever digging to reach.

Obstacles and Challenges: As you progress, the game introduces obstacles like toxic goo that destroys water,
 switches that control gates, and other elements that add complexity to the puzzles.

Achieving Goals: Each level has a specific goal, usually involving guiding enough water to
Swampy's bathtub while collecting all three ducks.

Special Levels and Challenges: Throughout the game, there are special levels and challenges that may require 
different strategies or introduce new mechanics.

It's a game that requires thinking ahead and planning your moves to solve puzzles effectively.

Design:

In the first and second stages of "Where's My Water?", the main objective is to direct water
 to Swampy the Alligator so he can take a bath. Additionally, players can collect three ducks
 scattered throughout each stage. As the game progresses to the third stage, a new challenge 
emerges: a box obstructs the water flow to Swampy. To overcome this obstacle, players need to
 redirect water to an upper box, which triggers a mechanism that opens the obstructing box.
 By successfully navigating these puzzles and managing the flow of water, players can ensure 
Swampy gets his bath, all while collecting ducks along the way.

Algorithm :

Magnetic Water: This is a Box2D algorithm that manages the gravitational interaction between separate blue balls.

Colour Rendering: This is an SFML algorithm that reads a colored map and defines each color as an object.
